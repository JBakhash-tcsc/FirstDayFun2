  /*
planning a funcion
what should it do? ->
check for a collision between the computer racket and the ball....
    
    Logical Truth -> booleans -> true / false
    integers -> 1 / 0
    
    We decided on a return type of boolean
    
    true means ai hit ball, false mean ai did not hit ball
    
    name computerHit
